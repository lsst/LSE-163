Unresolved topics:
- magnitudes for negative fluxes (and the issue of flux priors)
- how does Alert stream get its QA info? Where are metadata described?
     E.g. the # per CCD, CCD-to-CCD variance, xy cross-correlation
- what about False Source injection?
- how do we know centroids where forced photometry was performed
- do we really need 11 params for PSF model in Source? How about psfFlux and error,
   at the position of centroid (that is, don't refit for the position)

Large edits:
XXX - add dipole fit for DIASources
XXX - redesign of nightly Level 1 db; in sec. 4.2.1 bullet 6 need to mention 12 months window; see also
          bullet 8: the name of db? also, ``full'' light curves? ask Mario...
XXX - redesign of nightly Level 1 db: the main section is 4.3.5 (add Colin's plot?) also, remove reference
          to Level 1 db in 4.5.1
XXX - decide whether to move model description up front, and whether to add anything
XXX - make MOPS diagram and refer to it in Section 4.2.2
XXX - missing DIAForcedSource table; also, can DIASource be DIAForcedSource and ExtendedTable?
        ditto for Source and Forced Source  (look at models plus ``other'' data blocks)
TBD - DIASource: add both light centroid and peak PSF centroid (i.e. mode and mean), trailed source needs centroid
XXX - DIASource: add aperture mags
XXX - fpSky is on direct template image and rename it to fpBkgd
TBD - we need to bring back DIAForcedSource
XXX - adaptive moments in DIASource table (switch to xy), add moments for PSF
XXX - look for spuriousness in LSE-30 (OSS?), add to DIASource table?
XXX - do we want curved trail?   -> footnote
TBD - do we want to fit a gaussian convolved with PSF to each DIASource?

Jim:
- issue of adding Sources, like DIAObjects, to Object list  -> Tucson DMLT

Discussion of DBs, with Andy Salnikov, after reading LDM-135
- ``The LSST baseline database architecture for its real time Alert Production relies on horizontal
time-based partitioning. To guarantee reproducibility, no-overwrite-update techniques combined
with maintaining validity time for appropriate rows are employed.''
      -> what about deleting DIAObjects during MOPS processing?  (for LDM-151, not DPDD)

Mario:
- footnote 45: where is positionMotionLnL?  why are covariances separated if simul fit? Talk to Mario
- flags in DIAObject table: is there any info in other docs to add as a footnote? Talk to Mario
- SSObject table: why two values of MOID? Ask Mario.
- footnote 56: What Gbps WAN do we have now? Talk to Mario


Leftovers from Colin's Minutes for 2016-03-23:
- SAC: Alerts only include footprints for the detection band; is that enough?
- SAC: do we need more than 30 days of precovery fluxes for new DIASources?
        ZI: yes, 30 days is only about two data points in a given band and we don't
                know colors for transients
- ZI: science case for moving variable stars: how do we get LCs and pm/parallax?
- sophisticated matching of DIAObjects to 3 nearest Objects: might want to do
          the nearest star and the nearest galaxy, and the most probable object
- ZI: negative fluxes

Studies for Colin and/or Melissa:
- do we care about direction of NEO motion?
- do we care about curved trails?
- moving variable star: a bias in motion due to flux=const.?
  -- ** other?? **


For Tucson DMLT:

1) Proposal for Nightly Level 1 redesign.
The current baseline is described in DPDD, Section 4.3.5. We will review the
baseline and then discuss the redesign proposal using diagram (attached here):
https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45580703


Tentatively implemented in DPDD.

2) Proposal to perform forced photometry on both difference images
and direct images when Multifit is run in DR Processing.

Tentatively implemented in DPDD.

FYI: the size of ForcedSource table now is 1/4 (=50 TB) of the Source
table size at year 1 and 1/2 (=2 PB) of the Source table size at year 10.


3) How DIAObjects interact with Level 2 DRP processing?  Do we need
to add Sources?

See Jim's note:
https://community.lsst.org/t/unifying-diaobject-and-object-in-drp/716

Also, KT will report about various LL1db vs. DR association issues.

4)  proposal to abolish independent fits of BD galaxy model across bands and instead only vary the components a flux vs. band
what's the plan for arriving to this decision (e.g. process HSC data, or
LSST simulations, or degrade COSMOS data, etc; when?, by ComCam,
DR1, DR11?)


5)  iterative coupled processing of image coaddition and image differencing:
  do we need it or not?


Difference images help to make better coadds by masking moving and transient
objects. But better coadds result in better difference images, which then make
better coaddsâŠ


The remaining work in Tucson is to
- submit revised DPDD to CCB: we aim to have finalized DPDD circulated to DMLT
  at least a few days before the f2f in Tucson; we hope to stamp it for CCB there

- in Tucson, Thu/Fri, we will develop plans and diagrams for QA pipelines and for
  calibration product pipelines. Weâll probably use scipi-wg time on Thu for QA pipeline
  discussion, and Fri time for progress on calibration pipelines, as well as discussions
  started by Jim today




KT (from Tucson):
p. 6: is called "calibrated exposure" -> is called a "calibrated exposure"

Section 2.4: move entire section and diagrams to appendix, add forward
reference to LDM-151 for further details on implementation

(Mario) Need to define DIAForcedSource table

Forced DIASources used to update summaries in DIAObjects? Yes

p. 44: fit first to the coadds to initialize the more expensive multi-epoch
fitting -> fit first to the coadds and stored

p. 48: Remove "Two groups of" as well as blue sentence.  Consider saying
explicitly that these variability parameters are per-band.

p. 69: will consider rewriting -> may consider rewriting

----
We will also associate DIASources against the DIAObjects from the latest
DRP and include any match plus its DRP DIASources (and their contents)
in the Alert.  We will still associate against the Live L1 DB and
include the DIAObject match (possibly just-created) from there along
with its associated DIASources.

We will include an extract of the measurements of (all three) Objects in
the Alert as well.

We can save space in L1DB by rolling *versions* of DIAObjects older than
some date to tape (but never the most recent version of a DIAObject,
even if that is old).

DRP DIAObjects will look like L1 DIAObjects (although the exact code may
differ from L1).

Sources are an independent table, not fundamentally associated with
Objects.  Remove Sources from bullet 5 on p. 44; add a footnote
mentioning this.  Nearest Object may be recorded with the Source as a
convenience.
